# TheRailway
**The Railway gem provides a smooth, lightweight, productive and reusable way to build an operation using Railway oriented programing paradigm.**


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'the_railway'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install the_railway

## Usage
Build any service with the track! Add as many tracks as you want.


Consider the following class:
```ruby
class SingingOperation < TheRailway::Operation
    # this block only executes on successful steps! 
    # pass options to receive the operation states!   
    add_track :get_lyrics do |options|
      # we call this a success state based block!
      options[:do_some_thing] = 10
    end
    
    add_track :get_instruments_ready
    
    add_track :start_signing
    
    finally :receive_price #final step, wont execute after this step!
    
    def get_instruments_ready(options, mutable_data: , **)
      # do anything!
    end
    
    def get_lyrics(options, mutable_data: , **)
      mutable_data[:singer_name] = 'James' #mutate
    end
    
    def start_signing(options)
      puts options[:mutable_options]
    end
    
    def receive_price(options)
      puts "I am honored for this awesome price!"
    end
end
```

```ruby
@result = SingingOperation.({singer_name: 'Base Baba'})
@result.success? # => true
@result.failure? # => false
```
