# Clomp [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/rubyrider/clomp.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/rubyrider/clomp)

**Clomp gem provides a smooth, lightweight, productive and reusable way to build an operation using Railway oriented programing paradigm.**
Clomp will give you an easy interface to complete your service operation. You can use it with any framework 
or plain ruby object. 
## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'Clomp'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install Clomp

## Usage
Build any service with the track! Add as many tracks as you want.
tracks will be loaded sequentially. You can control success and failure state of any 
specific step.


Consider the following class:
```ruby
class SingingOperation < Clomp::Operation
    # this block only executes on failure step! 
    # pass options to receive the operation states!   
    add_track :get_lyrics do |options|
      # we call this a failure state based block!
      options[:do_some_thing] = 10
    end
    
    add_track :get_instruments_ready
    
    add_track :start_signing
    
    finally :receive_price #final step, wont execute after this step!
    
    def get_instruments_ready(options, mutable_data: , **)
      # do anything!
    end
    
    def get_lyrics(options, mutable_data: , **)
      mutable_data[:singer_name] = 'James' #mutate
    end
    
    def start_signing(options)
      puts options[:mutable_options]
    end
    
    def receive_price(options)
      puts "I am honored for this awesome price!"
    end
end
```

```ruby
@result = SingingOperation[singer_name: 'Base Baba']
@result.success? # => true
@result.failure? # => false
```
